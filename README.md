# Gym-Workout-Relational-Database
## Background
I didn't want to pay for mobile apps to track gym workouts, got tired of typing long lists in my notes app, and figured a spreadsheet would hold unnecessary duplicate values. I thought of creating a relational database so that I can access only the workout data I want to see at a given time.
