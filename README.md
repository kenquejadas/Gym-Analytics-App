# Gym-Workout-Relational-Database
## Background
I didn't want to pay for mobile apps to track gym workouts, got tired of typing long lists in my notes app, and figured a spreadsheet would hold unnecessary duplicate values. A relational database would display only the relevant workout data I want to see at a given time.

For example, I may want to look up my history of cardio workouts, which include the attributes Incline for treadmills and Level for Elliptical machines. Not all exercises will measure the same attributes; Incline and Level are irrelevant to weight lifting, yet they would be displayed as columns on a spreadsheet for all workouts. Even with separate tabs for exercise categories, I would be looking more data than I need at a given time. 

Through a SQL database, I am looking to find just the exercises and related attributes I am interested in at a given time while sharpening my database-related skillset.
